# FOOD STORE/ ONLINE RESTUARANT
##FOR THE LIVE LINK CHECK NAVINGATING THE SITE. PLS READ CAREFULLY.


AS TECHNOLOGY IS FAST REPLACING THE CONVENTIONAL WAY OF DOING THINGS, THE NEED FOR HAVING A TECHNOLOGY ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT TO FOOD / RESTURANT / LEAVING YOUR COMFORT ZONE SHOULD EVOLVE PAST THAT.
# THE WEBSITE OVERVIEW
THE SITE IN ITSELF IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT WAS BUILT WITH VANILLA CSS AND VANILLA JAVASCRIPT. SINCE THERE IS NO BACKENED/ DATABASE, TWO DATABASE WERE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED (FOR HE PRODUCTS AND FOR THE USER LOGIN PAGE). THE USER EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE PRETTY BAD AT THE MOMENT, BUT UPDATED VERSIONS WOULD BE SUBSIQUENTLY RELEASED. THE WEBSITE IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
# NAVIGATING THE SITE
HOME PAGE(INDEX.HTML) => LOGIN(LOGIN.HTML) => DISHES(MARKETPLACE.HTML)
 https://dearbornadeolu.github.io/SHOPPING-SITE/
# LOGIN PAGE
THE LOGIN PAGE WOULD ASK FOR TWO INPUTS
EMAIL : 'example@gmail.com' (ANYTHING DIFFERENT TO THAT WOULD NOT ENTER) 
PASSWORD: 'Tell' (PLEASE INPUT THIS SAME THING, WITHOUT THE QUOTATION MARK.)
# MARKET/ SHOPPING STORE
TO NAV BACK, GO TO THE BASE OF THE WEBSITE.
# POSSIBLE PROBLEMS 
AS I SAID THE SITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUTION, SOME LINKS MIGHT NOT WORK AS IT OUGHT TOO OR MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL, ALL THIS ARE STILL WORK IN PROGRESS.
# SOME SNIPPETS
